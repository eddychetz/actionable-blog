### Correlation analysis using `correlationfunnel` package in 10 minutes.
:::

For a Data Science team to build a good model, in-depth correlation analysis maybe the best tool to consider. This article is mainly focused on the use of `correlationfunnel` library to perform Correlation Analysis of the available data provided.

Import the important libraries to perform correlation analysis.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| message: false
#| warning: false

library(tidyverse) # for data wrangling
library(correlationfunnel) # for correlation analysis
library(DT)
library(DataExplorer)
```

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| message: false
#| warning: false

data <- read_csv("./train.csv")%>%
  mutate_if(is.character, as_factor)%>%
  select(-Loan_ID)%>%
  mutate(Credit_History = as_factor(Credit_History))%>%
  glimpse()
```
```{r}
library(skimr)
skim_without_charts(data)
```


```{r}
data%>%
  na.omit()%>%
  binarize()%>%
  correlate(target = Loan_Status__Y)%>%
  plot_correlation_funnel(interactive = TRUE)
```
